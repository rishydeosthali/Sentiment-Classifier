# Sentiment-Classifier
Sentiment classifier for Yelp reviews

In this project, we will build a classifier that can predict how a user feels (positively or negatively) about a given restaurant from their Yelp review. This is an example of user sentiment analysis. We will be able to quantify an individual's opinion about a particular topic merely from the words they use.
